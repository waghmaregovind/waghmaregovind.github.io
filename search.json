    "text": "Welcome to my personal website üëã!\nI currently work at Mastercard as a Senior Data Scientist. I manage transactional data, which encompasses tabular and temporal dimensions. It involves intricate temporal data modeling utilizing time-series analysis, temporal point processes, and temporal graph neural networks. Additionally, I am actively engaged in prototyping the integration of Large Language Model (LLM)‚Äìbased embeddings, harnessing their capabilities to optimize performance across transactional data scenarios. My daily responsibilities encompass the end-to-end process of designing, developing, and deploying machine learning and deep learning models at scale, ensuring robust and efficient solutions."
